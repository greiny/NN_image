1. Local Response Normalizatoin(LRN) on CNN is updated -> dataReader.h, dataReader.cpp, main.cpp
2. if GAP is true, bias neuron not included -> neuralNetwork.cpp, neuralNetworkTrainer.cpp

!Todo! 
layer integration input,hidden,output -> layer[0],layer[1],layer[2]
reading configuration file -> don't need to rebuild program
